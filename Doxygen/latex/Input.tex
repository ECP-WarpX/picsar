\subsection*{5. Configuration of the input file }

The input file is divided into sections. Sections start by {\ttfamily section\+::name} where {\ttfamily name} is the section name and end with {\ttfamily end\+::name}.

\paragraph*{A. cpusplit section}

This section enables to configure the M\+PI decomposition and other parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily nprocx}, {\ttfamily nprocy}, {\ttfamily nprocz}\+: number of processors in each direction x, y, z
\item {\ttfamily topology}\+: the M\+PI topology, 0 corresponds to cartesian
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{B. main section}

This section enables to configure the general simulation parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily nx}, {\ttfamily ny}, {\ttfamily nz}\+: number of grid points (domain discretization) in each direction
\item {\ttfamily xmin}, {\ttfamily xmax}, {\ttfamily ymin}, {\ttfamily ymax}, {\ttfamily zmin}, {\ttfamily zmax}\+: Origin of simulation axes
\item {\ttfamily t\+\_\+max}\+: final time
\item {\ttfamily nsteps}\+: can be specified instead of the final time, else nsteps is determine from the final time and the C\+FL condition
\item {\ttfamily ntilex}, {\ttfamily ntiley}, {\ttfamily ntilez}\+: M\+PI sub-\/domain discetization into tiles
\item {\ttfamily nguardsx}, {\ttfamily nguardsy}, {\ttfamily nguardsz}\+: guard cells for the field arrays
\item {\ttfamily njguardsx}, {\ttfamily njguardsy}, {\ttfamily njguardsz}\+: guard cells for the current arrays
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{C. solver section}

This section, {\ttfamily section\+::solver}, enables to controle the solver and algorithm parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily norderx}, {\ttfamily nordery}, {\ttfamily norderz}\+: Maxwell solver orders
\item {\ttfamily nox}, {\ttfamily noy}, {\ttfamily noz}\+: shape factor (interpolation) orders, note that optimized subroutines only work when {\ttfamily nox=noy=noz}
\item {\ttfamily currdepo}\+: current deposition algorithm
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily =0}\+: Esirkepov with tiling/\+Open\+MP and optimized for A\+V\+X512. For the moment, in 3D, only {\ttfamily nox=noy=noz=1} provides better performances.
\item {\ttfamily =1}\+: Esirkepov with tiling/\+Open\+MP and non-\/optimized. The functions provided for {\ttfamily nox=noy=noz} are much faster than using different orders (in this case, an arbitrary order subroutine with many if-\/statements is used).
\item {\ttfamily =2}\+: Esirkepov sequential
\item {\ttfamily =3}\+: Classical current deposition with Tiling/\+Open\+MP and optimized/vectorized subroutines. This provides the best performance even with A\+VX architectures.
\item {\ttfamily =4}\+: Classical current deposition with Tiling/open\+MP and non-\/optimized subroutines.
\item {\ttfamily =5}\+: Classical current deposition sequential
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily fieldgave}\+: field gathering
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily =0}\+: vectorized subroutine when {\ttfamily nox=noy=noz}
\item {\ttfamily =1}\+: non-\/optimized subroutines
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily rhodepo}\+: charge deposition
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily =0}\+: vectorized subroutines when {\ttfamily nox=noy=noz}
\item {\ttfamily =1}\+: non-\/optimized subroutines
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily partcom}\+: particle communications
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily =0}\+: Communications between tiles and between M\+PI domains is done in the same subroutine (overlapped computation) in parallel
\item {\ttfamily =1}\+: Communications are done seperatly
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{D. Plasma section}
