**Input file Configuration
===============================

The input file is divided into sections. Sections start by `section::name` where `name` is the section name and end with `end::name`.

####A. cpusplit section

This section enables to configure the MPI decomposition and other parameters:

- `nprocx`, `nprocy`, `nprocz`: number of processors in each direction x, y, z
- `topology`: the MPI topology, 0 corresponds to cartesian

####B. main section

This section enables to configure the general simulation parameters:

- `nx`, `ny`, `nz`: number of grid points (domain discretization) in each direction
- `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax`, `zmin`, `zmax`: Origin of simulation axes
- `t_max`: final time (0 by default)
- `nsteps`: can be specified instead of the final time, else nsteps is determine from the final time and the CFL condition (0 by default)
- `ntilex`, `ntiley`, `ntilez`: MPI sub-domain discetization into tiles
- `nguardsx`, `nguardsy`, `nguardsz`: guard cells for the field arrays
- `njguardsx`, `njguardsy`, `njguardsz`: guard cells for the current arrays

####C. solver section

This section, `section::solver`, enables to controle the solver and algorithm parameters:

- `norderx`, `nordery`, `norderz`: Maxwell solver orders
- `nox`, `noy`, `noz`: shape factor (interpolation) orders, note that optimized subroutines only work when `nox=noy=noz`
- `currdepo`: current deposition algorithm
   - `=0`: Esirkepov with tiling/OpenMP and optimized for AVX512. For the moment, in 3D, only `nox=noy=noz=1` provides better performances.
   - `=1`: Esirkepov with tiling/OpenMP and non-optimized. The functions provided for `nox=noy=noz` are much faster than using different orders (in this case, an arbitrary order subroutine with many if-statements is used).
   - `=2`: Esirkepov sequential
   - `=3`: Classical current deposition with Tiling/OpenMP and optimized/vectorized subroutines. This provides the best performance even with AVX architectures.
   - `=4`: Classical current deposition with Tiling/openMP and non-optimized subroutines.
   - `=5`: Classical current deposition sequential
- `fieldgathe`: field gathering
   - `=0`: specific order vectorized subroutine when `nox=noy=noz`
   - `=1`: specific order scalar subroutines when `nox=noy=noz`
   - `=2`: arbitrary order non-optimized subroutines  (WARP original) 
- `fg_p_pp_seperated`: field gathering + particle pusher
   - `=0`: field gathering + particle pusher in the same loop
   - `=1`: field gathering + particle pusher in the same tile
   - `=2`: field gathering + particle pusher separated
- `rhodepo`: charge deposition
  - `=0`: specific order vectorized subroutines when `nox=noy=noz`
  - `=1`: specific order scalar subroutines when `nox=noy=noz`
  - `=2`: arbitrary order non-optimized subroutines (WARP original)
- `partcom`: particle communications
  - `=0`: Communications between tiles and between MPI domains is done in the same subroutine (overlapped computation) in parallel
  - `=1`: Communications are done separately with OpenMP for the preprocessing loop
  - `=2`: Communications are done separately without OpenMP
  
- `lvec_curr_depo`: vector block length for the current deposition (8 by default)
- `lvec_charge_depo`: vector block length for the charge deposition (64 by default)
- `lvec_fieldgathe`: vector block length (field gathering cache blocking) for the field gathering (256 by default)

- `mpi_buf_size`: size of the mpi buffers for the particle communications (2000 by default)

####D. Plasma section

This section, `section::plasma`, enables to controle the plasma parameters:

- `nlab`: density in the laboratory
- `pdistr`: initial distribution
  - `=1`: ordered space initialization
  - `=2`: random space initialization
  
####E. Species section 

This section, `section::species`, enables to configure the species properties. It has to be repeated for each species. 

- `name`: species name
- `mass`: species mass normalized to the electronic mass
- `charge`: species charge normalized to the positron charge
- `nppcell`: number of particles per cell
- `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, `y_max`, `z_min`, `z_max`: plasma expansion in each direction
- `vdrift_x`, `vdrift_y`, `vdrift_z`: drift velocity in each direction
- `vth_x`, `vth_y`, `vth_z`: thermal velocity in each direction
- `sorting_period`: period of the sorting
- `sorting_start`: beginning of the sorting

####F. Sorting section

This section, `section::sorting`, enables to controle the particle cell sorting algorithm.

- `activation`: activation of the sorting
- `dx`, `dy`, `dz`: size of the sorting cells
- `shiftx`, `shifty`, `shiftz`: shift of the sorting grid

####G. Time statistic section

This section, `section::timestat`, enables to controle the time statistics information.
All main subroutines have internal timers.
The results of time spent in each part of the code can be displayed in the terminal or write in a file.
By default, the time statistics are given at the end of the simulation in the terminal.

- `activation` (`=0/1`): this flag activates output of the time statistics as a function of the iteration number in a file
- `period`: this is the period of the output in number of iterations
- `it_start`: iteration start for the time statistics
- `per_it`: print in the terminal the time statistics after each iteration
- `buffersize`: size of the buffer before writing in files (1 mean that the times are output every time steps, more mean that the results are stored in an array before being output)

####H. Temporal diagnostics section

This section, `section::temporal`, enables to use the temporal diagnostics.
Temporal diagnostics refers to the time evolution of integrated quantities such as the kinetic energy, the field energy, the total charge, the divergence of E...

- `frequency`: output period
- `format`: output format, this can be:
	- `=0`: for finary
	- `=1`: for ascii
- `kinE`: kinetic energy for each species
- `exE`: Energy of the x electric field component
- `eyE`: Energy of the y electric field component
- `ezE`: Energy of the z electric field component
- `bxE`: Energy of the x magnetic field component
- `byE`: Energy of the y magnetic field component
- `bzE`: Energy of the z magnetic field component
- `divE-rho`: Evolution of the norm(divE - rho)
