**HOW TO TEST PICSAR
============================================================

PICSAR includes several types of tests in order to check that the implementation is correct 
and that the code is correctly installed.

PICSAR currently have 3 types of tests:

- Tests that run the entire Fortran code
- Tests that run WARP + PICSAR
- Tests that run specific parts of the code to check  the implementation

All the tests are located in the folder `Acceptance_testing`.

**Testing the Fortran implementation
--------------------------------------

The tests for the Fortran code will be run in `Acceptance_testing/Fortran_tests`.

Input_files for these tests are localized in the directory `example_decks_fortran` and are accessible as case examples.

There are currently 3 tests:

- Drifted plasma: beams of electron-positron are generated at the center of the domain and propagates in each direction (x, y, z). 
This test enables to check that the boundary conditions are working properly.
- Homogeneous plasma: In this case, a thermalized homogeneous plasma is initialized in the whole domain.
This test checks that the global energy keeps constant as well as divE=rho/esp0.
- Langmuir wave: In this case, a neutral plasma is initialized and the electrons receive a kick in a given direction that generates a plasma wave (Langmuir wave).
This test checks that the energy keeps constant and that the plasma period is in agreement with the theory. DivE=rho0/eps0 is also checked.

These tests can be launched using the makefile. In this case py.test have to be installed because 
it will be used to supervise the simulation and check the results.

You can execute all the tests by typing:

> make -f Makefile test

Or you can execute them one by one:

- Drifted plasma:     `make -f Makefile test1`
- Homogeneous plasma: `make -f Makefile test2`
- Langmuir wave:      `make -f Makefile test3`   

You can run test the python scripts manually, for this aim:

- Go to the folder Acceptance_testing/Fortran_tests.

- You can perform each test one by one entering the different folders:
  - test_plasma_drift
  - test_homogeneous_plasma
  - test_Langmuir_wave
    
- You can run scripts using py.test: 
  > py.test -s --trun=1 --ttest=1
  
  - `--trun=0/1`: this option enables/disables simulation run
  - `--ttest=0/1`: this option enables/disables assert tests
  
- You can also run the scripts without py.test:
  > python <pyhthon_script> -r 1 -t 1
  
  - `-r 0/1`: this option enables/disables simulation run
  - `-t 0/1`: this option enables/disables simulation assert tests 

**Testing the Python implementation
--------------------------------------

The tests for the Python code (WARP + PICSAR) will be run in `Acceptance_testing/Python_tests`.

You can use the makefile (py.test is required) to launch the test scripts.

For all test, just type:

> Make -f Makefile_Forthon test

For each test one by one
  - Simple running test (does not work for the moment): `make -f Makefile_Forthon test1`
  - Langmuir wave: `make -f Makefile_Forthon test2`

**Unit tests
--------------------------------------

Unit tests enable to check that specific parts of the code are working properly and that several different algorithms are well giving the same results from the same initialization.

Unit tests are independant Fortran program that used the subroutines of PICSAR.
They can be found in the directory `Gcov_tests/Python_tests`.
