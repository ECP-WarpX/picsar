# **Installation of the PICSAR Python full mode**

In order to use highly scalable hybrid PSATD with WARP through PICSAR library, 
you will need to install FFTW_MPI and P3DFFT library.


P3DFFT library can be downloaded here:
"https://www.p3dfft.net/"
To install FFTW_MPI you can follow the instructions here :
http://www.fftw.org/fftw2_doc/fftw_6.html



## Editing configure file:

In configure file line 36: 
Set 
fftw_lib="/path_to_fftw_directory/lib"
p3dfft_lib="/path_to_p3dfft_directory/lib"

Detect the architecture you are using (example : edison+knl+intel)

You need to modify fargs variable that corresponds to your architechture by adding "-D FFTW=1" flag and the path to your fftw and p3dfft libraries
Example: if you are using MIRA then fargs should look like this (line 49):
fargs = '"-O3 -fopenmp -D FFTW=1 -I /path_to_fftw/include -I /path_to_p3dfft/include -ffree-line-length-none -ftree-vectorize -ftree-vectorizer-verbose=0  "'

Finally type:
python configure --full_pxr True --other_flags ...
