This folder contains a simple program which demonstrates how lookup tables can be generated. 
It can be compiled with cmake + make. On a few cores system table generation is expected to require ~ 30-60 minutes.

It might be useful to compile the table generator enabling machine-specific instructions for better performances.
It is also suggested to compile table generator with OpenMP support.

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build/
 $ cmake ../. -DOPTIMIZE_FOR_NATIVE=ON -DWITH_OPENMP=ON
 $ make 
 $ ./bin/qed_table_generator
