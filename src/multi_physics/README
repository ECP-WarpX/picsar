In order to test the PICSAR MULTIPHYSICS library
(which is header only) just do in this folder:

mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../.
make
make test

In order to test the integration of the PICSAR MULTIPHYSICS
library with a test program, do the following:

cd test_program/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../.
make
./bin_test_qed/testbed

The first time the program will be VERY slow because
it has to compute the lookup tables.
